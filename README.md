# weblink-chrome-ext

This is a simple client to connect to a local or remote linkbase. The Weblink add-on is designed to work in chrome 
and be compatible with firefox 54+.

1. Set linkbase location in the options page of this add-on
2. CRUD links

The repository ships the private key to sign the crx file. This is not an issue, since there is no public "binary" 
distribution of this add-on. The XPI files are signed by AMO.
